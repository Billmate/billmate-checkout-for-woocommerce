## Installation

### WooCommerce Settings

Otherwise callbacks from Billmate back to your store wonâ€™t work and orders will not be updated with the correct order status/information.
* To get the order total to match between WooCommerce and Billmate you need to configure WooCommerce to display prices with 2 decimals.
More information about displaying of prices and how it can cause rounding issues can be found in [this article](https://krokedil.com/dont-display-prices-with-0-decimals-in-woocommerce/).
