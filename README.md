## Installation

### WooCommerce Settings

* Make sure that you have enabled [pretty permalinks](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-permalinks/) in your WordPress installation.
Otherwise callbacks from Qvickly back to your store wonâ€™t work and orders will not be updated with the correct order status/information.
* To get the order total to match between WooCommerce and Qvickly you need to configure WooCommerce to display prices with 2 decimals.
More information about displaying of prices and how it can cause rounding issues can be found in [this article](https://krokedil.com/dont-display-prices-with-0-decimals-in-woocommerce/).
* It is recommended to enable **guest checkout** (Enable guest checkout setting in WooCommerce -> Settings -> Checkout).
